As part of the Crio Winter of Doing, Stage 2-B, the participants had to build an application where the users can upload and view memes.

The application currently supports 3 major operations:
1. GET: fetches all the memes from the database and displays it to the user.
2. POST: adds the memes entered by the user into the database. (Name of User, Caption for Meme, URL of the Image) 
3. PATCH: updates the already present memes in the database(can update only the caption or the meme URL)
